Some string info thoughts to implement.

* Strings can be made of many types of material.  Each string might have more than one type of material in its construction.

* Strings can be wound, which will give them several wire sub-components, which might be of differing diameter and material.
   - but do we want to track this?  Do we care?  Is this outside the scope of the database?
        * We care if we are collectors.

* String coatings - Elixir strings being the most common.  Property of the string, or the set it's in?

* Expected pitch of a string of a specific gauge is a function of the set it's in, rather than the string itself.

* String ends can probably be enumerated, though a table isn't the worst idea - it will just be pretty static.
    -  Ball ends, bullet ends, double ball ends, double bullet ends, color-coded ball ends.
