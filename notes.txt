I need to think about the design more, thought I think some stuff is figured out enough.

It's pretty clear to me that if you're going to store guitars, you've got make, model, serial number.  
So, guitar table has a sid, and FKs to make, model.  Serial should exist specific to that guitar, as should year of manufacture.

Don't forget scale length.  Should be attached to model.  

Should make chain through model?  Fender strats vs. other strats, Gibson vs. Epiphone Les Pauls.

Strings also have manufacturers, and I guess there's models.  
Material, purpose (acoustic, say).  
I mean, taking it to the extreme, you could break down each pack into a number of strings, each string is of a certain end, a gauge, a material, and where it matches in the set.

So, a set sid connects many-to-many with string-sids, with string number in that set put in the match.

Though, this leaves things a bit odd, because not all strings are constructed the same way, or of the same material.

Which makes keeping the string library sorted a little tricky, but not as much as it might be, depending.

So, each pack is a set, which is defined by a number of strings in the pack,    


Manufacturors might just get their own schema, because it seems odd to duplicate the data across several schemata, and I don't thing it necessarily belongs in the guitar schemata.
