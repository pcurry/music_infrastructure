Music Infrastructure:  A database-backed system for tracking all your kit.
Paul Curry, pcurry@gmail.com

This is the beginning of a system to track the state of my musical
instruments, their configuration, and their related gear & such.  I
started on it when I realized I didn't remember how recently I had
changed the strings on any of my guitars, let alone their current  
set up: string gauges, action, string brand, etc.  I decided I needed
a database to track all of these things, so I started writing one up.
I started with the database because I like doing relational databases.

This project is currently just the SQL to generate users, schemata,
and some tables.  That can all be found under ./sql, with descriptive
directory names.  I've done some directory renaming, and schema
redesign, which you can see in the logs.

The SQL as written uses PostgreSQL features like the SERIAL type.  I'm
working on targetting PostgreSQL 8.x for my DB platform.  I may make
it more standard in the future, and anyone who would like to fork this
to run on MySQL or what have you, please feel free to do so.  Please
either split the MySQL or what-have-you-specific SQL off into another
directory, or write the code standard enough that it is still
deployable to PostgreSQL.  Thanks!


TODO:
* Design & implement tables to hold abstract instrument data.
* Develop guitar & bass specific tables.
* Figure out how to represent instrument configurations, including
  ones I have used, as well as the current configuration.
* Load known existing instrument configurations into the DB.
